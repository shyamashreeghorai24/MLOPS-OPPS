1. Class and Object
2. Clsas has data/attribute and funcation/
>code walkthrough
>attributes get called itself, methods are called manually
3. Why Python is called oop? - everything in python is an object(data structure, data type etc.)
4. Advantages of OOPS:
    > You can create your own datatype
    (a + b)
    > code reusability
    >debugging
    >easy to colab  
5. End to end project (chatbook class) 
   >function vs method
   >encapsulation
   >getter and setter -> to get the hidden attribute and to set the hidden attibute
   >static method
   >Inheritance
   >Inheritance code example
   >Why inheritance is needed? (code reuseability, patent has no access to chile class)
   >constructure overloading and methos overloading>super keyword(can be used only inside class, can not access variable/attributes, used only inside child class)
   >types of inheritance -1. Single inheritance 2. Multiple Inheritance<diamond problen> 3. Multilevel 4. Hybrid 5. Hirarchical
